    ### ðŸ§© Key Takeaways
    - Reported delinquency in France has remained **relatively stable** over the past decade.  
    - **Regional contrasts** exist, with urban areas generally showing higher rates â€” 
      likely linked to population density and reporting frequency.  
    - The data highlights **patterns of reporting**, not necessarily patterns of crime.

    ### ðŸ§  Interpretation
    Numbers about delinquency carry weight in public discussions, but they only tell part of the story.  
    What we see here depends on how offences are declared, recorded, and processed â€” not just on what happens in reality.  
    Data helps **inform** debates, but it should never replace **critical thinking**.
    Data on delinquency only represents **recorded infractions**, not the full scope of lived experiences.
    Discrepancies often exist between **victimization surveys** and **official police data** â€”  some offences are never pursued or classified due to lack of proof or procedural limits.  

    ### ðŸš€ Next Steps
    - Compare these results with **socioeconomic indicators** (unemployment, education, density).  
    - Examine **seasonal or pandemic-related changes** in crime reports.
    - Explore **qualitative research** to understand underreporting and public perception.

    Hopefully it provided a clearer, more balanced view of how reported delinquency evolves across France.
